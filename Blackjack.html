<span style="font-weight: normal">A computer program was designed to
simulate hands in Blackjack in order to find the statistical
significance, if any, of card counting in Blackjack. The  program
showed that with a penetration point deep enough into the deck (90
percent), a card counter can expect to win money over time. However,
the counter’s edge here is only about 0.2 percent per hand on
average.</span></p>

<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">Blackjack is one of the most well
known and most played gambling card games in casinos. Like all casino
games, the house has the edge. The house expects to always take home
money in the long run. Which is why they try and entice as many
customers to play as much as possible. Because they know, according
to the law of large numbers, that overtime the aggregate of results
will approach the mean. On any one hand the house might lose
considerably, but the house knows that it will eventually recoup its
losses and then some as more and more people gamble their money away.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: normal">Rules of Blackjack:</span></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">Blackjack is probably the most well
known name of any game that one can find in a casino. It is
synonymous with gambling, casinos and money in modern culture. One of
the key reasons for Blackjack’s popularity, other than its catchy
name, is the supposed prospects for a player to get an edge on the
house. To prove the house always has the edge in other games such as
Roulette or Slots is a trivial matter. However, to prove the edge of
the house in Blackjack is slightly more difficult. There are many
rules, variations, strategies and variables in Blackjack. The basic
rules of Blackjack are simple. It is the player/s versus the house
(from here on out, I will refer to the house as the dealer). The goal
of the game is to have your hand total more than that of the
dealer’s. Each card in a deck has a certain value, an Ace is either
1 or 11 (whichever is more beneficial for the player), a number has
the value of itself (a 3 is a 3) and then all face cards are 10. Each
player is dealt two cards, dealer included. The players can see each
others’ cards, but only one of the two cards the dealer has is
visible. The player then decides if they want to hit (receive another
card) or stand (stay at their current hand’s total) based on the
total their cards have and what the dealer shows. The highest total a
hand can have is 21, if you go over 21 you bust. If a player busts,
they automatically lose their bet. The dealer does not make choices
or use strategy when hitting or standing. If the dealer has less than
17 they hit, if they have 17 or more they stand (note that there is a
soft 17 variation to blackjack). If the dealer has more than the
player, the player loses their bet. If the player has more than the
dealer, the player wins their bet. If they tie, the player keeps
their bet but receives no extra money. There also is a special hand
called Blackjack. The namesake of the game. If a player is dealt an
Ace and either a 10 or face card, they automatically win the hand (as
long as the dealer does not have a Blackjack as well). The payout for
a standard win is 1:1, whereas the payout for a Blackjack is 3:2
(modern casinos have started to switch to 6:5, which a person should
never play in as the odds severely favor the house in this instance).

<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">After the basic rules, there are
some additional, more nuanced rules. The game variations I looked
into when creating my simulation were doubling, splitting, soft 17,
surrender and insurance. Doubling is when a player can double their
bet after receiving their hand. It can only be done when a hand has
two cards. Some casinos only allow doubling on 9, 10 or 11, others
allow doubling at any time. In my code, doubling is allowed for any
card total. Splitting is when a player is dealt two of the same card.
The player can split their cards into two hands by placing the same
size bet on the new hand. A player is then dealt one new card to each
hand and now plays both hands separately, one at a time. When
splitting there are several catches. In most cases, when splitting
aces, the player can only receive one card and cannot hit again.
Also, a blackjack on split aces (or ten valued cards) does not count
as a blackjack, only as a hand with 21 score. Some casinos allow
doubling down as well after splitting, others do not. Some also limit
how many times a player can split. In my code a player can split as
much as they would like and can double down if they would like.
However, aces only receive one more card after splitting.
Surrendering is when a player, after receiving their hand, can choose
to pay half their bet and surrender their hand. They guarantee
themselves a loss, but in certain circumstances it is the best
option. Insurance is when a player can pay a small amount (varies by
casino) as insurance against a dealer having blackjack. This is only
necessary when the dealer shows ace. Soft 17 refers to when a dealer
must hit. If a dealer has a soft 17, meaning an ace counted as 11 to
reach a value of 17, then the dealer either must hit or must stand
depending on the variation. My code allows for either, but the data
was collected for standing on soft 17. </span>

<span style="font-weight: normal">Card Counting:</span></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">Now that the rules are explained
and understood, it is time to discuss card counting. The idea is
quite simple. If I know what cards have already been dealt, then the
odds of receiving particular cards goes up or down and my play
changes accordingly. In Blackjack there are tables with basic
strategy. They tell you what to do given a particular hand and a
particular card shown by the dealer. The tables I used in my
simulation were borrowed from the website 888casino. With no card
counting being done, then a player would bet the same amount on each
hand and play each hand according to basic strategy. This is
guaranteed to lose the player money over time. However, if a player
counts the cards that have been played, then the player is supposed
to be able to turn the odds their favor. There are many different
card counting systems, but the most common and simplest is the hi-lo
technique. In the hi-lo technique, a player starts the count at zero
before any cards from the deck have been dealt. Then, if a 2-6 is
dealt the player adds 1, if a 10, face card or Ace is dealt the
player subtracts one. If 7-9 is dealt the player holds the count.
Therefore, if the count is high than it means there are a lot of 10
value cards and aces left. If the count is low, there are
predominantly more low cards left. A high count puts the deck more in
the players favor. Therefore, a player is supposed to increase their
bet amount in a high count deck and decrease in a low count. There
are also strategy variations that correspond to different counts. The
most famous are the illustrious 18 and the fabulous 4. Both have a
player diverge from basic strategy depending on the count. The
simplest change to understand is the insurance divergence in the
illustrious 18. Typically, a player would not buy insurance when a
dealer shows an Ace. However, the illustrious 18 says if a dealer
shows Ace and the count is 3 or higher, the player should buy the
insurance. This is because two main reasons. If the count is 3 or
higher a player will have made a larger bet (according to counting
rules) and have more reason to want insurance. Also, if the count is
3 or higher, than it statistically more likely for the dealer to have
a 10 value card underneath equaling a blackjack. The other variations
follow this same principle. I used the illustrious 18 and fabulous 4
strategies as mentioned on 888casino.com. </span>

</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">Originally card counting was very
effective before casinos caught on. With only one deck and a long
penetration point (point at which the dealer reshuffles all the
cards), a player could get a strong picture of the cards remaining in
the deck. To combat this, casinos started using multiple decks in
their Blackjack games. Though theoretically this should have a
minimal effect on the counting capabilities as long as the
penetration point is still deep into the decks. The change in the
count due to multiple decks is simply take the running count you have
and divide by the decks left. That’s because a running count of +6
with 6 decks remaining is less suggestive than a +6 with one deck
left. The large count is essentially diluted by the large amount of
cards left. Due to the multiple decks, it takes longer for a player
to see a high count (a pro-player count) as you have to divide by 6
deck initially (then 5 and 4 and so on). Therefore, the bet spread
for a multiple deck game also changes. If we take our standard bet
amount as one unit, then a player using the most common 1:12 bet
spread would bet 1 unit for a count of one or lower, 2 units for a
count of 2, 4 units for a count of 3, 8 units for a count of 4 and 12
for a count of 5 or higher. Clearly then, a player stand to risk the
most money on higher count games (when the cards are significantly
higher in their favor). </span>

<span style="font-weight: normal">Simulation:</span></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">This study used a simulation
written in python with object oriented programming. There were four
classes created: Card, Deck, Hand, Blackjack. Card was a card that
contained its suit and rank. Deck created a list of objects that was
52 objects long containing each of the cards in a standard 52 card
deck. Hand is a child of Deck that allows a user to label it and the
hand is initialized as empty instead of populated with all 52 cards.
Blackjack was a much longer and more complex object with 8 inputs.
The inputs are number of players, number of decks, use surrender, use
count, use count multiplier, dealer hits soft 17, penetration point
and random seed. Number of players currently only works with it equal
to one but can easily be upgraded to multiple players. Number of
decks should only be set to 3 or greater (the strategies for playing
with one and two decks are not included in the code). Use surrender,
use count and use count multiplier just allow the user to set if they
want to allow late surrenders, count cards (and use the illustrious
18 variations) and if they want to vary their bets based on the
count. Hit on soft 17 sets if the dealer will or will not hit on a
soft 17. Penetration point sets at what point the dealer reshuffles
the deck (with 1 being immediately and 0 being when all cards have
been dealt). Random seed sets the random seed used for the random
shuffle module that shuffles the decks. </span>

<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">A second code was used to run the
simulation of many hands. Initially the user could set the number of
rounds to be played to whatever they would like. However, this was
changed after more thought as the number of rounds could end mid deck
or at the end of a deck or beginning. Introducing wide variability in
the outcome of playing. Therefore, it was changed such that the user
could only simulate one pass through the deck. That way it was
consistent with how the outcome would be. Then, many instances of one
pass through the deck could be simulated and averaged to find the
expected outcome. However, this too was somewhat limited. As the
random seed for shuffling might just have been a fortunate or
unfortunate seed to allow a user to do well or poor (with enough
simulations this would not be true, but my computer lacks the
computing power to handle many simulations). Instead, another loop
was added to run multiple simulations of the many decks being played
for multiple initial random seeds. Then, finally, a last loop was
added to vary the penetration point from .1 to .25 to .75 to .9. So
in the end there were four penetration points tested that used 100
different random seeds, that took the average of 1000 instances of a
pass through the deck. This was also tested for both the case when a
player was counting cards and changing their bets and strategies as
well as the instance when they were not.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: normal">The simulation showed that for long
penetration points, a player can expect to win money over time.
However, as the penetration point is decreased, the player’s
statistical advantage decreases. As the penetration point approaches
1, it also approaches the case of no counting. This makes sense, as
the penetration point approaches 1, the player has less and less time
to count cards. If the dealer were to shuffle immediately after every
hand, than the count would always be reset to zero before the next
bets are placed. Severely hampering our player’s advantage. The
tables below show the winnings per hand and standard deviation per
hand based on a 10 dollar bet as a standard bet for different
penetration points. </span>

<span style="font-weight: normal">As seen in the table above, the
penetration point was very important for the results of the counter.
Another interesting thing to note is that the results of the
non-counters have nothing to do with the penetration point. This
actually makes sense, as the non-counter never changes strategy and
so would not pay attention to what cards have and have not been
dealt. The table has a clear indication that counting positively
affects a player’s performance. Even for low penetration points
(.75 and .9), the counter significantly out performed the non
counter. The counter unsurprisingly does better the farther the
penetration point is. These results seem to favor the house a little
more than what can be found online. The most likely culprit is the
current simulation uses a basic strategy that is either outdated or
not correctly affiliated for all the settings of the game simulated
(soft 17, surrender, insurance, doubling rules etc.). It was quite
difficult to find the strategy tables for specific game variations
and for specific deck sizes. I chose to use 6 decks in the simulation
simply because this is the most common choice by casinos in Las
Vegas. Another limitation of the code is the length of the
simulation. I was only able simulate 1000 hands for 100 seeds with
four different penetration points. Even still, this simulation would
take multiple hours. The reason for this (other than it is a lot for
a computer to simulate) is that the code used for the simulation has
not been properly optimized for large-scale simulations. A further
edition of the code that critically looks at minimizing processing
time would be quite helpful for larger simulations. Aside from that,
I simply would not more computing power than a 2013 mid-shelf laptop
can provide. </span>

<span style="font-weight: normal">Other important results from the
simulations to check for validity and accuracy were the rate of
blackjacks and the rate of winnings a hand. According to statistics,
the probability of receiving a blackjacks is (4/13)*(16*n/(52*n-1))
where n is the number of decks. In a six deck game, this probability
is approximately 4.75%. My simulation found the probability of a
blackjack being dealt to be about 4.8% depending on the run.
According to wizard of odds
(</span><font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://wizardofodds.com/ask-the-wizard/blackjack/probability/"><span style="font-weight: normal">https://wizardofodds.com/ask-the-wizard/blackjack/probability/</span></a></u></span></font><span style="font-weight: normal">)
the probability of a player winning a hand is 42.42%. My simulation
found the probability for winning a hand without counting to be about
42.3% and with counting to be about 40.1%. So without counting I had
almost the exact supposed probability of winning a hand. The lower
number for the probability of me winning a hand with counting seems
odd though. My initial inclination would be that counting should help
a player win more. My best guess is that the smaller win rate is
because counting causes a player to surrender quite often, which
would result in a player playing less hands. In a 10000 game
simulation, a player typically surrenders about 0.2 percent of the
time. This could account for some of the difference. The rest of the
difference I would assume to be up to some error in the illustrious
18 strategy or quite possibly somewhere else in my code entirely. </span>

<span style="font-weight: normal">I also created several histograms
of a normal distribution for the count and non count cases for each
of the penetration points. I will only show the two extreme cases (.1
and .9) as they are succinct in displaying the characteristics of
interest. I created the normal distribution using numpy’s
random.normal module with 50000 samples on the cases given their
means and standard deviations as found from the simulations. I
believe a normal distribution is a good distribution to use here as
the possibilities for winnings per hand are continuous and we would
expect a bell curve shape around the mean. </span>

<span style="font-weight: normal">The first graph is the late
penetration point (10 percent of the cards remaining) and the second
is the early penetration point (90 percent of cards remaining). The
orange plot is for non count and the green is for count. In the first
graph it is quite clear that the variance in the non count situation
is much less than that in the counting situation. This makes sense,
because the non-count always bets 1 bet-unit while the count can bet
1 up to 12 bet units depending on the count. We can also see that the
peaks of the two are different, but only slightly so. Suggesting the
margin for winning is quite small. The variance in the count is very
large while the mean is just barely in the positive (0.02 when
betting 10 per hand). Therefore, any given time one were to play
blackjack, the chances of gaining or losing money is almost 50/50,
with the odds only ever so slightly in your favor. It would require a
substantial amount of playing time to have any confidence that the
player would win money. Here, the law of large numbers really would
require a large number. In the second graph, the normal distributions
are quite similar. The count distribution still has its peak slightly
more to the right than the non count (ie less money lost per hand).
If the dealer shuffles often, counting becomes almost useless.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: normal">Discussion: </span>
</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">From the simulations created,
counting can win a player money. However, the extent of the
“winnings” are quite small. A player can expect on average to
take home only 0.2% of their bet per hand assuming they are playing
in a game with favorable rules (late surrender, insurances, split
Aces, double on any value etc.) and a late penetration point (0.1 %
of deck) for a 6 deck game. A shorter penetration point quickly wipes
out any advantage the player has. On average, one can expect to play
about one hand of Blackjack per minute. Therefore, a player can
expect to take home 12% of their standard bet amount per hour.
Minimum wage in the US varies by state but if we assume a 10 dollars
per hour minimum wage, then a player would need to set their bet
amount to roughly 90 dollars per hand to make minimum wage.
Unfortunately for our player though, this assumes a 40 hour work
week. Counting cards in Blackjack is not conducive to this much
playing time. Legally speaking, counting cards is perfectly fine.
However, casinos reserve the right to refuse the service of playing
to any player at any time. This means if you are counting cards and
are caught, you will be forced to stop playing. Once caught, a casino
is likely to also share your information and photos with other
casinos to prevent you from playing in the area. Thus, getting in 40
hours a week, every week is highly unlikely. Another issue, is a
player must always have the right count and play the right strategy.
The margins for success are so slim that only the rare mistake is
still enough to push a player from the green into the red. To add
more struggles to the play, as we saw in the histogram of the
player’s results per hand, the winnings have a lot of variance.
This can mean certain days with extreme success, but it also means
certain days with extreme failures. The players must have enough
capital when playing to be able to withstand the days of extreme
failures. Finally, the player cannot just play obviously based on the
count. As the player would quickly be caught for counting cards.
Instead, they have to deviate their playing style and strategy
slightly from what would be expected in order to hide the fact that
they are counting. All of this added up means counting cards is not a
get rich quick scheme. At least not a get rich quick and easy scheme.
It requires a lot of hardwork, practice, thought and planning.</span></p>

<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">Not all is bad though. The player
has a few tricks to help in their attempt to win money. The strongest
strategy they can use is a team. A player counting cards has to spend
a lot of time idly passing hands by in order to wait for a good count
on the deck. The player has to bide their time until the count is in
their favor, then make a quick killing and then get out before a
casino could notice or catch them. Therefore, a team is a good place
to make counting cards better for a person. A team can have multiple
people playing at teams, counting cards and biding their time for a
high count. Then, when I high count does happen, another teammate
with a lot of money can quickly come in (after being signaled by
their teammate that the count is high and what the count is) and make
a lot of aggressive bets. Then, the player would quickly leave with
the money gained from the high count rounds and not have to waste the
time nor money nor hide their playing while they count is low. </span>

<span style="font-weight: normal">Conclusion:</span></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<span style="font-weight: normal">Overall, the simulation was a
success. The code was able to successfully simulate large quantities
of rounds of Blackjack and vary the player’s strategy and betting
pattern based on the count. The code also allows a user to set a few
parameters on the rules of the game to be simulated such as late
surrender, dealer hits soft 17 and the amount of decks. There are
still some areas for improvement as well. For one, the ability to add
additional players would be useful. Also, the strategy tables for
single and double deck games needs to be included. Currently a user
has to change the source code somewhat for complete control of game
rules, which also could be changed. These are all minor adjustments
that would be rather easy to implement given time. One issue the may
or may not be a problem and thus the greatest area of interest and
concern for the code, is if the simulation to strongly favors the
house. The rate of blackjack for a player and the rate of winning for
a player (sans counting) appears to agree closely with other people’s
results. However, once counting is involved, a player seems to win a
little less often. This may be expected, but I have been unable to
find anyone else’s work online on if this is the case or not. What
I did find surprising and what seems to not agree with previous work
(though this too was hard to find evidence of online) was the
winnings a player made while counting. According to some sources
online, a player’s edge should be closer to 0.5% when counting
(with the given game rules etc. that I used) and should only by -2.5%
when not counting. I found the players edge to b 0.2% when counting
and -7.0% when not. Strongly favoring the house. Again, this could be
a fault in my code or it could be the correct results. I could not
find enough evidence online to convince me that I was wrong, but I
did find enough to make me question my results slightly. To fix this
would be a much more esoteric battle than to add multiple players, as
the source for the discrepancy is unknown and fixing it might be
simple or difficult once found. The hardest bugs in coding to solve
are the ones when you do not know you have one. Whether the code is
right or wrong would not change the conclusion for the prospects for
making money by counting cards all that much. Either way, the margins
are low, the risks are high and task is difficult. I can say I will
not test my mettle versus Vegas, except on the off chance I am there
for another reason entirely. </span>
